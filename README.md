# TK Notes App

A simple notes app that uses Web Storage and IndexedDB API to store a user's notes on their browser.
It is designed using [Material Design](https://material.io/design) web guidlines.


The application is running [here](https://tk-notes-app.herokuapp.com/).

### Installing
The app needs to install dependencies before it can run locally. You install all the dependencies by typing ``npm install``


### Launching
After installing, you can launch the app on your local device by typing ``npm start``. After that you will need to go to ``http://localhost:3215/`` on your Google Chrome browser to use the application.


### Builidng
Building the app is not neccessary when you have it installed on your local device. It is used by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to optimise all the
files and assets for deployment. If you still want to build the application, you can type ``npm run build``.
